# Database Management Project using MySQL on phpMyAdmin

# Introduction
As part of my portfolio, I am excited to present a SQL project showcasing my database management and query optimization skills. This project demonstrates my ability to design, implement, and manipulate databases using the MySQL relational database management system.

# Phase 1: Designing a Database

Subjects covered:
- Design database using Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD);
- Normalisation;
- Relation database modeling techniques.
  
Objectives:
- Learn that database design is an iterative process;
- Develop elegant logical models for a database.

# Phase 2: Implementing a Database

Subjects covered:
- Using Data Definition Statements (DDS) to implement a database on the given ERD and database schema:
  + CREATE DATABASE
  + CREATE TABLE / DROP TABLE
  + Constraint implement queries: PRIMARY KEY / FOREIGN KEY / UNIQUE / NOT NULL / CHECK / AUTO_INCREMENT
- Write Data Manipulation Statements (DMS) to query a database, insert & update data in tables
  + Populating & modifying data: INSERT INTO VALUES / UPDATE
  + Manipulating data: SELECT / CONCAT / WHERE / GROUP BY / HAVING / ORDER BY / LIMIT
  + Aggregate functions: SUM / AVG / MIN / MAX / COUNT
  + Sorting: ASC / DESC
 
Objectives:
- Gain awareness of the typical challenges related to the practical implementation of databases;
- Be able to use DDS to implement a database from a given ER diagram and the corresponding Database schema;
- Be able to use DMS to query a database in order to test and validate data and constraints.
