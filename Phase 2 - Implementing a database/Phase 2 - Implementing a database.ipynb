    "In this section, we will dive into the implementation phase of the VictoryRide Transport Services database. Here, we will focus on the crucial aspects of database creation and data management using Data Definition Statements (DDS) and Data Manipulation Statements (DMS). We will explore code snippets with brief explanation that demonstrate how to define the structure of the database, create tables, enforce constraints, and insert data. Additionally, we will delve into the realm of querying the database using DMS to extract meaningful insights, validate data integrity, and ensure the effectiveness of the implemented constraints. Through these code snippets, we will gain hands-on experience in implementing a robust and well-structured database solution for VictoryRide Transport Services."
